# Scratch-Game
Small project for problem set 0 in Havard University's Introduction To Computer Science Course CS50.

# Usage
To play the game:
 - From github, download the game file "project (CS50)" to your computer and open it in https://scratch.mit.edu/ site.
  - or 
  - Go to this url https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/401843027/
  
# What I Learned From this Project:
  - How computers represent information using binary representation. Be it Letters of an alphabet, Emoticons, Color, Etc... (0's & 1's)
  - Computational Thinking: Algorithms. A computer's step by step instructions to be followed to solve a given problem. Example: A Calculator!
  - basic programming language (functions, conditions, boolean expressions, loops) and how to do something useful with them like creating my 1st project (game).
